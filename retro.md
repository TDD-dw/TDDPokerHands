# Day 1, round 1 - group member names: Devon Wigle, Shan Li, Robert Sullivan, Eva Lieu, Brian Oxley

## How does this feel?

- Clunky~

## What to do differently?

- Create roadmap of requirements to test
- Level set, get on the same page about the TDD we are doing (level of abstraction)

# Day 2, roudn 2 - group member names: Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Eva Lieu, EJ Yi, Emy Tausevich

## How does this feel?

- had fun! more coding this time
- mob tool pretty straightforward after used once
- hard to balance thinking/sharing; there are different styles to driving/mob talking
- when driving, can say "i'm thinking of doing this / do we have thoughts on x part of the code"
- we had good discussion on TDD, styles of testing, and what was valuable to test (s/o Emy!)
- pulling up docs is helpful!!

## What to do differently?

- adhere to timer!

## What to keep doing?

- Keep expressing unfamiliarity with a syntax or concept! And then pull up docs.

# Day 3, round 1 - group member names: Shan Li, Mark Sinclair, Kondal Ajjarapu, Robert Sullivan, Devon Wigle

## How does this feel?

- Smoother
- a good learning experience
- feels good to write code again

## What to do differently?

- Update the readme (facilitators)
- little talk about implementation strategy at the beginning
- Define our goals
## What to keep doing?

- Helping each other along the way
- mob program is great
- Keep to the timer

# Day 3, round 2 - group member names: Shan Li, Mark Sinclair, Kondal Ajjarapu, Robert Sullivan, Devon Wigle

## How does this feel?

- About the same
- Bad about losing code
- Knew what we were doing this time

## What to do differently?

- make sure mob next is done before mob start
- don't do pre-mature optimization
- 5 minutes felt short, try 6 or 7

## What to keep doing?

- little strategy discussion at the beginning of round, that is 5 minutes, but not part of someone's coding turn
- debate best way to write/refactor code

# Day 4, 1/19 , round 1 - group member names: Shan Li, Mark Sinclair, Kondal Ajjarapu, Paul Rinaldi, Devon Wigle

## How does this feel?
-learned things 
-getting closer to the final solution
-discussing topics without getting stuck
-prioritized better
-worked bottom up, able to focus on functionality on a smaller scope


## What to do differently?
-check on setup like github cred, ide before mobbing 


## What to keep doing?
-keep using 5 min. timer 
-keep expressing different ideas 
-pseudo code = helpful when mobbing
