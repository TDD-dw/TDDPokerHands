# Day 1, round 1 - group member names: Devon Wigle, Shan Li, Robert Sullivan, Eva Lieu, Brian Oxley

## How does this feel?

- Clunky~

## What to do differently?

- Create roadmap of requirements to test
- Level set, get on the same page about the TDD we are doing (level of abstraction)

# Day 2, roudn 2 - group member names: Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Eva Lieu, EJ Yi, Emy Tausevich

## How does this feel?

- had fun! more coding this time
- mob tool pretty straightforward after used once
- hard to balance thinking/sharing; there are different styles to driving/mob talking
- when driving, can say "i'm thinking of doing this / do we have thoughts on x part of the code"
- we had good discussion on TDD, styles of testing, and what was valuable to test (s/o Emy!)
- pulling up docs is helpful!!

## What to do differently?

- adhere to timer!

## What to keep doing?

- Keep expressing unfamiliarity with a syntax or concept! And then pull up docs.
